			This is an example dashboard that demonstrates how to add a RDP icon to a table.
			Clicking the icon will initiate a RDP session to the selected server.
		</p>
		<p>
			The search in this example is using a lookup file called servers.csv for demonstration purposes.
			Normally, you would use a "real" search, but this should get you started in the right direction.
		</p>
